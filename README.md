DISPLAY AIR QUALITY INDEX



RESEARCH:
The U.S. Air Quality Index (AQI) is EPA's tool for communicating about outdoor air quality and health. The AQI includes six categories, each corresponding to a range of index values. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality. For each pollutant an AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to an ambient air concentration that equals the level of the short-term national ambient air quality standard for protection of public health. AQI values at or below 100 are generally thought of as satisfactory. When AQI values are above 100, air quality is unhealthy: at first for certain sensitive groups of people, then for everyone as AQI values get higher. The AQI is divided into six categories. Each category corresponds to a different level of health concern.


ANALYSIS:
Based on the concept of AQI, I have made an air quality indicator, where the user will enter the AQI level of their area and the output will show the quality of air in their surroundings, namely: GOOD, MODERATE, POOR, UNHEALTHY, SEVERE, HAZARDOUS.

IDEATION:
Develop a C program to show the Air Quality of a particular area on the basis of its AQI. The program should prompt the user to input the AQI for their area. Using control structures the program should assign the Air Quality level according to predefined criteria. Finally the program should display the Air Quality Level for the given AQI.
Algorithm:
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Input AQI from User
Step 3: Check the AQI value, find where the level lies
Step 4: Print the Air Quality Level
Step 5: End
